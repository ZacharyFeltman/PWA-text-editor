# PWA JATE Text Editor
Using PWA a user can create notes or code without an internet connection.  Using Heroku, when a user deploys add, they can install the text editor to their computer so that the application can be used without internet access.

## Objectives

 - When the user opens the application in editor, then user should see client folder structure
 - When rpm start is run, then the backend server and client should start up
 - When user runs text editor from terminal, then the JS files should be bundled using webpack
 - When user runs webpack plugins, then the user should have a generated HTML file, service worker, and manifest file
 - When user uses next-gen JS in application, then user should see that the text editor still functions without errors
 - When user opens the text editor, then they should find that the database has created a database storage
 - When content is added and the user clicks away from the DOM window, then content should be saved to database
 - When the user reopens the text editor, then the content should be retrieved from the database.
 - When user clicks the install button, the application should be downloaded for the user.
 - When web application is loaded, there should be a registered service working using workbox
 - When user registers a service worker, there should be pre cached static assets when loaded.
 - When Heroku app is deployed, there should be a proper build scrips for webpack application.
